Why write in English?

1. Local environment. If we write in the mother tongue, people around would
understand what we are writing more easily. Sometimes we want not to be
disturbed.

2. For others to read. English is the world language. When there are
readers with various natural language background, English would be a good
choice of written language. Easier reading results in higher productivity
and more convenience.

Use Plain Text as Data Format

Note: However, user interfaces are another thing. It seems good to use GUI. 

1. Tools to view and edit.

For others to read and write. The target audience do write code, and the code
is plain text, therefore the target audience do have plain text editors and
they are familiar with their editors, such as Vim, Emacs and VSCode.

Tools are important. People use different platforms, such as BSDs, various
Linux distributions, Windows, macOS on M1, ARM, x86, x64 etc. It is
challenging for tools to support various platforms. For this reason, it is
challenging to invent new tools.

That's the point. If use other invented format other than plain text, new
tools are needed to be invented. Tuning the new tool bug-free on one certain
platform is challenging enough, not to mention so many platforms.

Since there are tools, the file becomes easily manipulated.

This becomes especially convenience when embedding view and edit functionality
to other applications. A text edit widget is good. Imagine developing one
dedicated view and edit widget for thousands of SDKs: Qt, Gtk, C#, Android,
macOS, iOS ...

2. Search. Plain text is naturally searchable.

3. Freedom. No speical tools makes the format freedom. The users would not be
forced to do something or not by the user interface of the dedicated editors.

4. No file corruption, like what happens in databases. When something goes
wrong, the user could always go for a look.

Why not auto-wrap but wrap by hand?

So that the diff output would be easier to read, especially when using Git.
The diff utility was designed for code text, and therefore works by line. Code
text is like poetry text, where there are frequent line breaks.

Therefore, the choice of line length, like 80 characters, is less important.
