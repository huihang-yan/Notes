Why write in English?

1. Local environment. If we write in the mother tongue, people around would
understand what we are writing more easily. Sometimes we want not to be
disturbed.

2. For others to read. English is the world language. When there are
readers with various natural language background, English would be a good
choice of written language. Easier reading results in higher productivity
and more convenience.

Why plain text?

For others to read and write. The target audience do write code, and the code
is plain text, therefore the target audience do have plain text editors and
they are familiar with their editors, such as Vim, Emacs and VSCode.

Tools are important. People use different platforms, such as BSDs, various
Linux distributions, Windows, macOS on M1, ARM, x86, x64 etc. It is
challenging for tools to support various platforms. For this reason, it is
challenging to invent new tools.

That's the point. If use other invented format other than plain text, new
tools are needed to be invented. Tuning the new tool bug-free on one certain
platform is challenging enough, not to mention so many platforms.
